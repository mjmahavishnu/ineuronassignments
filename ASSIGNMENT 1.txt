ASSIGNMENT 1

Q.1     IN THE TEST OF CAT EXAM THE POPULATION S.D IS 100.
          A SAMPLE OF 25 TEST TAKERS HAS MEAN OF 520.
          CONSTRUCT A 80% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL ABOUT MEAN.

Solution
Confidence Interval Range = (Point Estimate - Margin error) to (Point Estimate + Margin error) 
Since, there is only one sample taken,
(If more than one sample had been taken,we would have had to calculate the mean of the distribution of sample means)
We can assume the mean of the sample as point estimate of the mean of population.
Therefore,
Point estimate of mean of population = Mean of the sample
Point Estimate = 520
Margin error = Zsignificance value/2 * (Standard Deviation of population)/(Number of Sample)1/2
Significance value = 100% - 80%
                                   = 20%
                                   = 0.20
Therefore, Significance value/2 = 0.10
Z score of 0.10 = 0.5398 -------------------------------------------------- 1
(Standard Deviation of population)/(Number of Sample)1/2  = 100/251/2
(Standard Deviation of population)/(Number of Sample)1/2  = 100/5
(Standard Deviation of population)/(Number of Sample)1/2  = 20 ------------ 2
                                                                                                                  
Therefore, Margin Error =  1 * 2
                 Margin Error = 0.5398 * 20
                     Margin Error = 10.796
Therefore, Confidence Interval Range = (Point Estimate - Margin error) to (Point Estimate + Margin error) 
Confidence Interval Range  = (520 - 10.796)   to (520 + 10.796)
         Confidence Interval Range  =  509.204   to 530.796

Therefore 80% Confidence interval about mean for SAT test scores is 509.204 to 530.796
